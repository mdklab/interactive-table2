# CSV → Interactive Table

This repository will host a small web experience that lets users select a local CSV file, explore it through an interactive table UI, and deploy the finished experience on GitHub Pages. The core requirements are:

- Upload a local CSV file (no size restrictions).
- Display the CSV in a table that offers sorting and filtering controls across columns.
- Deliver a production-ready SPA or static site that can be hosted on GitHub Pages without server dependencies.

The `stack-options.md` document sketches several viable tool stacks so that we can choose a direction before implementing the UX.
